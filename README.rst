What is it?
------------

+ getWAKE (v1.6) is a collection of Matlab subroutines and GUI for post-processing of bluff-bodies wake data measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), and analyzed by OpenPIV (or other) software. 

+ getWAKE accepts PIV wake data as .mat files extracted from the OpenPIV-spatial-analysis-toolbox. Future version of the code will also support .vec files. 

+ getWAKE allows the user to re-construct a full unsteady wake image from a set of PIV images recorded behind bluff-bodies using a cross-correlation algorithm, which overlaps consecutive images. 

+ getWAKE allows the estimation of drag and cumulative circulatory lift forces from the wake data, thus enabling the user to estimate the loads exerted on the body generating the wake.
